# Description
To complete this task we need to create a responsive webpage that fetches data from a public API and dynamically displays it.
Step 1: Get the API Key
First,we need to sign up for the API to get an API key.
Step 2: HTML Structure
Create a simple HTML file (index.html) for your webpage structure. It should include a container to display the weather data.
Step 3: CSS for Responsiveness
Create a simple styles.css file for styling. This will ensure the webpage is responsive and looks good on different devices.
Step 4: JavaScript to Fetch Data from API
In the app.js file, write the JavaScript that will fetch the weather data when the user enters a city and clicks the button.
Now Enter a city name in the input box and click the "Get Weather" button.
The weather data will be fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed dynamically on the page.
How It Works:
When the user enters a city and clicks the button, the fetch function sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.
The weather data is then processed and displayed dynamically on the webpage. If the city is not found or there's an error, a corresponding message will be shown.
